            <h1>Kanban Definition</h1>
            A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress,
            and
            maximize efficiency (or flow). It can help both agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work.
            Kanban
            boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the
            right
            amount of work, and get it done!


            <h2>History</h2>
            The Japanese word “kanban”, meaning “visual board” or a “sign”, has been used in the sense of a process

            manufacturing.
            On the other hand, the capitalized term “Kanban” is known and associated with the emergence of the “Kanban
            Method,”
